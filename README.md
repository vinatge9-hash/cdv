# Brew & Beans Coffee Shop Website

A complete, responsive coffee shop website built with Tailwind CSS (CDN) and semantic HTML. This project follows the coffee shop design system and provides four pages with a ready-to-deploy structure.

Files included:
- index.html — Home / Hero section with overview and quick links
- about.html — Our story, values, and sustainability notes
- menu.html — Coffee and bakery menu with prices
- contact.html — Contact form and business details
- README.md — This documentation

How to run:
1) Open the four HTML files in your browser (no server required).
2) Optionally host on any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

Design notes:
- Font choices: Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body (Coffee Shop defaults)
- Color palette tailored for a coffee shop: warm browns and cream tones
- Background hero images use placeholder tokens that can be replaced with real assets

Accessibility & SEO:
- Semantic HTML: header, nav, main, section, footer
- Alt attributes for images (where present); hero uses a background image with overlay for readability
- Descriptive page titles and meta descriptions (in a full deployment, update meta tags accordingly)

This project adheres to the four-page structure and can be extended with more pages (e.g., events, locations, or a dedicated blog) while preserving the existing design system.
